# FastQue Admin Dashboard 2.0 — assessment and plan

Status: Phase 1 in progress. Started 2026-10-26 on `feature/nitesh-development`.
This document is the source of truth for what the blueprint asks for, what the current system can
already answer, and what needs new tracking before it can be reported honestly.

## 1. Current architecture (what exists today)

| Area | What is there | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monorepo | npm workspaces: `apps/backend` (NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL), `apps/web` (Next.js, client admin pages), `apps/mobile` (Expo), `packages/shared` (types, zod schemas, path constants) | root `package.json` |
| Auth / RBAC | JWT + refresh cookie; `@Roles()` + global `RolesGuard` on every route; admin login is password/Google **plus mandatory TOTP** | `apps/backend/src/auth` |
| Internal roles | `PLATFORM_ADMIN`, `CO_FOUNDER`, `HR_ADMIN`, `SALES_ADMIN`, `PLATFORM_VIEWER` (read-only), `FIELD_EXECUTIVE` | `Role` enum |
| Admin UI | `/dashboard/admin` (platform overview, shops, staff, customers, recent activity, **Shop activity** date filter), `/crm` (field CRM + analytics), `/employees`, `/verification`, `/access` | `apps/web/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/admin` |
| Admin API | `GET admin/overview`, `GET admin/shop-activity`, CRM analytics/pages, verification, employee and access management | `apps/backend/src/admin` |
| Owner analytics | per-shop overview, revenue, peak hours, capacity — single-shop scoped | `owner-ops`, `dashboard-analytics` |
| Time zones | per-salon `timezone`, IST default; helpers in `common/timezone` | |

### Data the reporting can rely on

| Need | Source | Quality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scheduled appointments | `Booking` (`slotStart`, `createdAt`, `status`, `source` = APP / WEB / WALK_IN / IN_SHOP, `cancelledByActor`, `cancellationReason`) | Good. No `completedAt`; completion time comes from the linked queue entry. |
| Live / walk-in visits | `QueueEntry` with `source = WALK_IN` (`joinedAt`, `serviceStartedAt`, `serviceCompletedAt`, `status`) | Good. Walk-ins are **not** `Booking` rows. |
| Scheduled vs live | `Booking` vs `QueueEntry.source = WALK_IN`; an appointment that checks in becomes `QueueEntry.source = APPOINTMENT` and stays a booking | Good — satisfies "a checked-in scheduled booking stays scheduled". |
| Service items + price snapshot | `BookingService` (name, duration, price snapshot); legacy single-service bookings fall back to `Booking.service` | Good for appointments. Walk-ins only have the **current** menu price → reported as an estimate. |
| Actual service time | `ServiceSession` (`startedAt`, `endedAt`, `COMPLETED`) and queue `serviceStartedAt/CompletedAt` | Good. |
| Chairs / hours | `Chair`, `OperatingHours`, `StaffWorkingHours`, `ManualChairOccupancy` | Enough for utilisation (Phase 3). |
| Salon lifecycle | `Salon.createdAt`, `status`, `VerificationRequest`, CRM lead → salon attribution | Partial: no lifecycle event history, no activation timestamp. |
| Sales attribution | `EmployeeCrmLead` (employee → onboarded salon), visits, follow-ups | Partial: one owner per lead, no effective-dated territory history. |
| Money | Customer `Payment`/`Refund` (prepayments), shop `Invoice`/`InvoicePayment` (shop's own billing), `CustomerSubscription` (customer Premium) | **FastQue platform revenue (commissions, shop subscriptions, ads) is not recorded.** |
| Merchant app activity | Only refresh-token/session rows | Not an activity log — cannot say "owner used the app on N days". |
| Geography | `City` → `Region` (state) → `Country`; no sales regions or areas | Territories must be added. |

## 2. Requirement mapping

Legend: ✅ can build on existing data · 🟡 partial / estimate · ⛔ needs new tracking first.

| Blueprint section | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 Global filters — date presets, IST, previous-period comparison | ✅ | Built in Phase 1 slice 1. Geography/salesperson/source filters next. |
| 3 CSV/XLSX export | ✅ | Phase 1; CSV first (formula-injection safe). |
| 4 Executive KPIs: salons registered / active / serving, bookings created / completed / cancelled / no-show, live vs scheduled, service value, service hours, avg value, rates | ✅ / 🟡 | Walk-in value is an estimate (current menu price). |
| 4 FastQue platform revenue | ⛔ | Shown as "Not tracked yet", never as zero. Needs a platform-fee ledger. |
| 4 Daily / weekly / monthly active salons (commercial) | ✅ | Defined on completed visits. |
| 4/5 Merchant engagement (app usage) | ⛔ | Needs a merchant activity-event table. Kept separate from booking activity. |
| 5 Adoption categories | 🟡 | Booking-based categories now; the "15 active app days" part of *Highly active* waits for activity events. |
| 5 Lifecycle milestones as history | ⛔ | Needs `salon_lifecycle_events` (additive migration) + backfill from existing timestamps. |
| 6 Shop-wise performance | ✅ | Table in slice 1; detail page in slice 2. |
| 7 Booking analytics (status, actor, hour/day, lead time, source) | ✅ | `cancelledByActor`, `source`, `createdAt` vs `slotStart` exist. Status-transition history ⛔ (no table). |
| 8 Service-wise reporting | 🟡 | Per-salon `SalonServiceCategory` exists; needs a canonical platform category mapping. |
| 9 Hours & utilisation | ✅ | Phase 3: sessions + chairs + operating hours. |
| 10 Revenue & monetisation | 🟡 / ⛔ | Salon service value ✅; FastQue revenue ⛔. |
| 11 Cancellations & no-shows | ✅ | |
| 12 Live queue monitoring | ✅ | Predicted vs actual wait needs prediction snapshots ⛔ (`estimatedWaitMinutes` is only the latest value). |
| 13 Regional sales | 🟡 | Needs territories, effective-dated assignments, targets. CRM gives visits / leads now. |
| 14 Customers & retention | ✅ | Account customers only; guests are not identifiable across visits. |
| 15 AI / marketing | ⛔ | Needs discovery/agent event tracking. `BookingAttributionCampaign` covers shop campaigns. |
| 16 Alerts & action centre | 🟡 | Rules can run on existing data; alert/task tables are new. |
| 2 RBAC — Director, National Ops, Regional/City manager, Finance, Support | ⛔ | New roles + territory scoping. Until then the command centre is limited to `PLATFORM_ADMIN`, `CO_FOUNDER`, `PLATFORM_VIEWER`. |

## 3. Phases

**Phase 1 — Core MVP** (this branch)
1. ✅ Shop activity: shop-wise bookings and live queue with IST date filter (`admin/shop-activity`).
2. 🔄 Executive Command Center (`/dashboard/admin/command-center`, `admin/analytics/overview`): KPI cards with previous-period change, completed-visits trend, shop adoption distribution, salon performance table.
3. Booking analytics page: status / cancellation actor / source / hour-of-day / day-of-week / lead time.
4. Service performance: canonical category mapping + per-service KPIs.
5. CSV export for every Phase 1 table, audited.
6. Geography filter (state → city) on all Phase 1 endpoints.

**Phase 2 — Sales and adoption** — territories + effective-dated assignments, lifecycle events, merchant activity events, onboarding funnel, recovery table with follow-up tasks, new roles.

**Phase 3 — Operations and finance** — utilisation + heatmap, queue prediction snapshots, platform-fee ledger, reconciliation, alert rules.

**Phase 4 — AI and growth** — discovery/agent event tracking, attribution, retention cohorts, forecasting.

## 4. KPI definitions (implemented)

All dates are IST calendar days (`Asia/Kolkata`). "Previous period" is the same number of days immediately before the selected range.

| KPI | Definition | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Registered salons | Salons created on or before the end of the period | Snapshot at period end |
| New salons | Salons created inside the period | Event (`Salon.createdAt`) |
| Open salons | Salons whose status is `ACTIVE` right now | Current state (no comparison) |
| Serving salons | Salons with ≥ 1 completed appointment or served walk-in in the period | Event |
| Appointments booked | Bookings **created** in the period, any status | Event (`createdAt`) |
| Completed appointments | Bookings with appointment time in the period and status `COMPLETED` | Event (`slotStart`) |
| Walk-ins served | Walk-in queue entries that joined in the period and were `COMPLETED` | Event (`joinedAt`) |
| Completed visits | Completed appointments + walk-ins served | Derived |
| Cancelled / No-show | Bookings with appointment time in the period and that status | Event (`slotStart`) |
| Cancellation rate | Cancelled ÷ (completed + cancelled + no-show) appointments | Pending/confirmed excluded from the denominator |
| No-show rate | No-show ÷ (completed + no-show) appointments | Only resolved attendance outcomes |
| Completed service value | Appointments: price snapshot of the booked services minus the online-booking discount. Walk-ins: current menu price of the chosen service (**estimate**, shown separately). Salon money — **not** FastQue revenue. | Event |
| Average visit value | Completed service value ÷ completed visits with a known value | Derived |
| Completed service hours | Sum of `endedAt − startedAt` of completed service sessions that ended in the period | Event (actual times) |
| FastQue platform revenue | Not tracked yet — returned as `null` and shown as "Not tracked" | — |

### Adoption categories (as of the end of the period, 30-day window)

Thresholds live in one place (`ADMIN_ADOPTION_THRESHOLDS` in `packages/shared`) and are proposals, not industry standards. Admin-editable thresholds are Phase 2.

| Category | Rule (first match wins) |
| --- | --- |
| Recently onboarded | Registered within the last 7 days |
| Never activated | No completed visit ever |
| At risk | Previous 30 days had ≥ 10 completed visits and the last 30 days fell by ≥ 50 % |
| Highly active | ≥ 20 completed visits in the last 30 days *(merchant-app-days criterion waits for activity tracking)* |
| Moderately active | 5–19 completed visits |
| Low usage | 1–4 completed visits |
| Dormant | Completed visits before, none in the last 30 days |

## 5. External data / tracking still required

1. Platform-fee ledger (commission, convenience fee, shop subscription, featured listing, ads) with earned vs collected vs settled.
2. Merchant activity events (meaningful owner/staff actions, de-duplicated per day).
3. Salon lifecycle events table + backfill.
4. Booking status-transition history (actor, timestamp, reason).
5. Queue wait-prediction snapshots.
6. Territories, effective-dated sales assignments and targets.
7. Canonical service-category mapping.
8. Discovery / AI-agent / campaign event tracking.

## 6. Scale notes

Phase 1 queries are grouped aggregates over indexed columns (`bookings(salonId, slotStart)`, `bookings(salonId, createdAt)`) with ranges capped at 92 days. The adoption view scans every salon once per request; before ~10k salons this should move to a nightly `salon_daily_metrics` summary table (Phase 3) with an explicit "data as of" time. No latency targets are claimed until measured.

## 7. Admin Dashboard 2.1 (UI redesign, charts, live shop status)

Started 2026-10-27 on `feature/admin-dashboard-2.0`.

| 2.1 phase | Status | What exists |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A — Admin app shell | ✅ | `components/admin/shell/*`: the owner dashboard's rail + sidebar + toolbar styles (`owner.module.css`), 13 sidebar sections from one registry (`admin-nav.ts`), shared IST reporting period in the top bar (kept across pages for the browser session), phone drawer. Owner routes and navigation are untouched; the public header/footer step aside on `/dashboard/admin/**`. Sidebar items whose data is not recorded open an honest "Planned" page that names what is missing — never sample numbers. |
| B — Chart builder | ✅ (partial) | `/dashboard/admin/analytics/chart-builder`, `GET admin/analytics/timeseries`: up to 6 KPIs, daily/weekly/monthly, previous-period overlay, line / column / area / combination per series, one y-axis per unit (a third unit is refused, never mixed), legend toggles, hover tooltip, CSV + PNG export, full screen, saved views. **Gaps:** saved views live in the browser (no `ChartPreferences` table yet), no zoom, no geography/salesperson filters, hourly granularity not offered. |
| C — Customers & staff | ✅ | `/dashboard/admin/customers` + `/staff`, `GET admin/customers`, `GET admin/staff`, four audited CSV exports (see below). Analytics responses carry no contact data: customers are masked IDs, staff are display names. |
| D — Open / closed shops | ✅ (partial) | `/dashboard/admin/shops/status`, `GET admin/shops/status`: scheduled open/closed from weekly hours in each shop's own time zone (overnight hours, closed days, "unknown" when hours or zone are missing), owner's "closed for today", accepting bookings, opening/closing within an hour, "open with no bookings for 4 h", hour-by-hour scheduled-open shops vs visits for today. **Not available:** merchant-app online (not recorded), holiday/one-time exceptions and effective-dated schedule history (no tables) — so no historical open-shop charts. |
| E — QA | 🔄 | Unit tests for schedule rules, buckets, query validation, chart config, combo chart, navigation and route access; SQL checked against a local QA database. Not done: load testing. |

### Shop status definitions

| Status | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Scheduled open / closed | The shop's configured hours for today (and yesterday's overnight hours) contain / do not contain the current instant, in the shop's time zone. Equal open and close times = 24 hours. |
| Hours unknown | No hours, no hours for today, or no resolvable time zone — never counted as closed. |
| Temporarily closed | Owner switched on "closed for today" (`Salon.isClosedForToday`). |
| Accepting bookings | Shop is ACTIVE and not closed for today. |
| Open, no bookings | Scheduled open, accepting bookings, and no new booking or walk-in for ≥ 4 hours since it opened (proposed default). |
| Counts | Only ACTIVE shops are counted as open/closed; pending and suspended shops are listed but not counted. |

### Customers, staff and data exports (phase C)

**Permissions** (`ADMIN_PERMISSION_ROLES` in `packages/shared`, enforced per route by the backend RolesGuard; the web app only mirrors them):

| Permission | Roles | Route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| View customer analytics | Platform admin, Co-founder, Viewer | `GET admin/customers` |
| Export customer report (no contacts) | Platform admin, Co-founder | `GET admin/exports/customers` |
| Export customer contacts | Platform admin | `GET admin/exports/customers/contact` |
| View salon-staff analytics | Platform admin, Co-founder, HR, Viewer | `GET admin/staff` |
| Export staff performance | Platform admin, Co-founder, HR | `GET admin/exports/staff` |
| Export staff contacts | Platform admin, HR | `GET admin/exports/staff/contact` |

Contact exports are separate routes, so no query parameter can turn a report into a contact file.

**Privacy rules**
- Customer analytics count **account customers** only; guest visits have no stable identity. Customers are shown as a masked, non-reversible ID (`C-` + 10 hex of a SHA-256 of the account ID).
- No analytics response selects phone, email or name (verified against the QA database: zero identifiers in either response).
- Customer contact export: deleted accounts excluded; phones on the global contact-suppression list are withheld when `CONTACT_LEDGER_HASH_KEY` is configured — otherwise the file and its audit row say the check could not run. Account customers have no name field, so none is exported.
- The web page asks for an explicit purpose confirmation before any contact download.

**Audit** — every export, including a failed one, writes an `audit_logs` row: `action = ADMIN_DATA_EXPORT`, actor, export ID, category, period, field set, row count, outcome and the suppression check. No new table was needed.

**Definitions**
- Customer visits = completed appointments (appointment time) + completed live-queue walk-ins (join time). New = first-ever visit in the period; returning = active − new; repeat rate = active customers with ≥ 2 visits ÷ active.
- Staff figures come from completed service sessions (one staff member each, so no double counting). Value = current menu price of the service (estimate). Utilisation = service minutes ÷ minutes in the staff member's configured weekly hours, counting days up to today only; "—" when no hours are set. Leave/absence is not recorded.

**Not done** — server-side expiring download links (files stream directly to the authorised request), XLSX, territory-scoped exports (needs territories), customer city (not recorded).
