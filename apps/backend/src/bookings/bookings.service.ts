  /**
   * Owner-operations mission - the SHOP cancels a booking (owner, an authorized barber for their
   * own appointment, or a delegated platform admin; authorization is the caller's job).
   *
   * Differences from the customer path above, all deliberate:
   *  - the customer is never charged: a shop-initiated cancellation creates no cancellation charge
   *    and no ledger due, whatever the policy's late-cancellation window says;
   *  - attribution is trusted metadata: cancelledById/cancelledByActor/cancellationReason are
   *    written in the same transaction as the status change from the AUTHENTICATED actor;
   *  - a visit that has already started cannot be cancelled this way (IN_SERVICE/COMPLETED entry).
   * It takes the SAME per-booking advisory lock as the customer path, so a customer cancel and a
   * shop cancel racing each other can never both succeed, double-restore credits, or double-notify.
   * Notifying the customer is NOT done here: it must never be able to roll this cancellation back.
