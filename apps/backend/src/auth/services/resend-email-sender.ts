/**
 * Production transactional email via Resend's single-endpoint HTTP API (no SMTP, no library
 * beyond the platform `fetch` already used by TwoFactorOtpSender). Chosen for the same
 * "smallest reliable solution" reason as 2Factor for SMS: one API key, one POST per email, no
 * queue/webhook infrastructure required for launch. Requires:
 *   - RESEND_API_KEY: the account's API key (Resend dashboard -> API Keys).
 *   - EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS: a "from" address at a domain verified in Resend (Domains -> Verify).
 *     Sending from an unverified domain is rejected by Resend itself before this code runs.
 * Never logs the API key, the recipient's raw email is only ever logged on failure (matching
 * TwoFactorOtpSender's convention of logging enough to debug without logging secrets), and the
 * reset/invite URL itself (which embeds a live single-use token) is never logged at all.
