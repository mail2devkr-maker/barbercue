// living in two places. Fraunces (a warm, characterful serif with real editorial presence at
// display sizes) carries headings; Work Sans, a clean and slightly warmer alternative to the
// ubiquitous Inter/Helvetica-everywhere look, carries body copy and UI chrome — the pairing is the

// "force dark" page-darkening heuristic; a `<meta name="color-scheme">` tag in <head> is the
