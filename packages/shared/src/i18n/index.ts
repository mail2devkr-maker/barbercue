// Phase 14 (Localization & Voice Operations).
//
// Scope is deliberately narrow: the short, high-value phrases actually spoken aloud by
// Speech.speak() / speechSynthesis on realtime queue and booking alerts (apps/mobile's
// QueueStatusPanel/OwnerBookingsScreen, apps/web's DashboardQueueView/OwnerBookingsView), plus the
// language switcher's own labels. This is NOT a general UI-string translation layer — the rest of
// the product stays English-only in this phase, same "real slice, honestly scoped" pattern as
// every other phase (see BARBERCUE_NON_PAYMENT_FEATURE_STATUS.md).
//
// Extensibility contract: adding a language means adding one Language enum value (../enums) plus
// one complete VoiceAnnouncements object + one SPEECH_LOCALE entry + one LANGUAGE_LABELS entry
// below — TypeScript's Record<Language, VoiceAnnouncements> makes an incomplete addition a compile
// error, not a silent English fallback for the new language.
